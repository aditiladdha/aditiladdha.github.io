I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the [Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization](https://www.aco.gatech.edu/) program at Georgia Institute of Technology. I am fortunate to be advised by [Santosh Vempala](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~vempala/). I received my B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Bombay. 

#### Research Interests

  - High Dimensional Sampling and applications 
  - Convex and Combinatorial Optimization
  - Machine Learning and Robust Estimation
  - Markov Chain Monte Carlo Algorithms

#### Activities

  - I gave a talk about high-dimensional sampling at the [Northwestern 2021 Junior Theorists Workshop](https://theory.cs.northwestern.edu/events/2021-junior-theorists-workshop/)
  - I gave a talk on [Algorithms for Sampling Convex Bodies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TzrtDhN2xc) about the convergence of Gibbs Sampling/CHAR and Weighted Dikin Walk at the [Sampling Algorithms and Geometries on Probability Distributions Workshop](https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/gmos2021-1) at the Simons Institute

#### Fellowships and Awards

  - Awarded the [2020 Microsoft Research Ada Lovelace Fellowship](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/2020-ada-lovelace-and-phd-fellowships-help-recipients-achieve-broad-research-and-educational-goals/) by Microsoft
  - Awarded the [ARC-TRIAD Student Fellowship](http://arc.gatech.edu/education) by the [Algorithms and Randomness Center](http://arc.gatech.edu/education) for Spring 2020
